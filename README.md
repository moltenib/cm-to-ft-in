# cm-to-ft-in
Two scripts, which convert centimetres to feet and inches.

Given the same number, the two scripts will print the same result with up-to-one-decimal precision. One is written in Python; the other is made for the Unix shell.

The shell script is the fastest.

```shell
# Decimal numbers are accepted
Usage: ./cm-to-ft-in.sh CM
       ./cm-to-ft-in.py CM
```
