# cm-to-ft-in
Three small programs, which convert centimetres to feet and inches.

Given the same number, the three scripts will print the same result with up-to-one-decimal precision. They are written in different languages.

```shell
# Decimal numbers are accepted
Usage: ./cm-to-ft-in.sh CM
       ./cm-to-ft-in.py CM

# To use the C-based script
cd C
make
./cm-to-ft-in CM
```
